Project Overview :
This project presents a set of interactive visualizations to analyze and compare the impact of two major global events - the Great Recession (2007 - 2009) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) examining their impact on various aspects of the U.S. economy. The analysis focuses on key economic indicators such as unemployment rates and homeownership rates across selected states: Texas, North Carolina, and New York.

Key Visualizations :
Unemployment Rate: A comparison of unemployment rates before, during, and after the Great Recession and COVID-19.
Homeownership Rate Changes: How homeownership was affected by both crises.

Data Sources :
The data used in this project is sourced from:
FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) - https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/ 

Technology Stack :
Tableau – For data visualization and interactive dashboards
Excel/CSV files – For raw data processing

How to View the Visualizations :
To explore the Tableau visualizations, follow these steps:
  - Download the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) file from this repository.
  - Open the file using Tableau Desktop.
  - Interact with the dashboards to analyze the impact of the Great Recession and COVID-19.

Insights & Conclusion :
Unemployment Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp and sudden rise in unemployment, while the Great Recession led to a slower but longer-lasting increase.
Homeownership Impact: Homeownership rates dropped after both crises, but the recovery process was different for each.
State-Level Differences: The impact varied across states due to differences in industries and government policies.
